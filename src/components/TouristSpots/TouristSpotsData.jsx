    description: 'Originally, Wat Saeng Siritham Floating Market; there were boats selling goods on the river and on the rafts too. But, now the merchant can no longer sit in the boat because when the big boats passing through, it will cause waves to sway the boat. After that, the boat was canceled, and they come up on the raft instead. Now, this place is more like a food raft in front of a temple than a regular restaurant. There are a la carte food, noodles, Thai desserts, and beverages. On land, there are authentic fruit shops of Muang Non garden.'},
